=== the memory of the user space program ===
KGTP can read memory directly without stop this user space program.  For example:
{{{
#Connect to KGTP(it is different with the way that is introduced in before)
(gdb) target extended-remote /sys/kernel/debug/gtp
#Add a new inferior to parse info of the user space program.
(gdb) add-inferior
Added inferior 2
#Switch to this inferior
(gdb) inferior 2
[Switching to inferior 2 [<null>] (<noexec>)]
#Load the symbol of the program this you want to read
(gdb) file ~/kernel/svn/bak/a.out
Reading symbols from /home/teawater/kernel/svn/bak/a.out...done.
#Attach to the program (it will not stop the program).
(gdb) attach 10039
Attaching to program: /home/teawater/kernel/svn/bak/a.out, Remote target
Reading symbols from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
Loaded symbols for /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
Reading symbols from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
Loaded symbols for /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()
#Then you can read the value of this program.
(gdb) p c
$3 = -1222013392
(gdb) p c
$4 = -590910451
}}}
In this example, I used some multiple Inferiors commands.  Please goto [http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Inferiors-and-Programs.html] get more info about it.
